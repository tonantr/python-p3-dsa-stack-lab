# Stack Lab

## Learning Goals...

- Implement a `Stack` using a list as the underlying data structure.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Sequence**: a data structure in which data is stored and accessed in a
specific order.
- **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In
First Out (LIFO)
- **Index**: the location, represented by an integer, of an element in a
sequence.
- **Iterable**: able to be broken down into smaller parts of equal size that
can be processed in turn. You can loop through any iterable object.
- **Slice**: a group of neighboring elements in a sequence.
- **List**: a mutable data type in Python that can store many types of data.
The most common data structure in Python.
- **Tuple**: an immutable data type in Python that can store many types of
data.
- **Range**: a data type in Python that stores integers in a fixed pattern.
- **String**: an immutable data type in Python that stores unicode characters
in a fixed pattern. Iterable and indexed, just like other sequences.

## Instructions

In the previous lesson, you learned what a `Stack` is and what methods they
commonly include. In this lab, you will be building out an implementation of a
`Stack`. You will be using a list as the underlying data structure, and
calling on some built-in Python list methods to build your `Stack` class's
functionality.

Start by forking and cloning this lab. You'll be writing your code in the
`lib/stack.py` file. You can run the tests at any point using `pytest -x` to
check your work.

### Bonus

If you'd like an extra challenge, try implementing the additional functionality
below. There are tests for these in the `testing/stack_test.py` file; uncomment the
**bonus methods** section in the test file to try these out.

1. Modify your `Stack __init__()` method to take an optional `limit` value and
   set that as an attribute.

2. Update the `Stack push()` value to only push the passed-in value if there's
   still room in the `Stack`. If the `Stack` is full, the method should throw an
   error.

3. Implement the following additional methods:

- `Stack size()`: returns the number of elements contained in the `Stack`
- `Stack empty()`: returns true if the `Stack` is empty; false otherwise
- `Stack full()`: returns true if the `Stack` is full; false otherwise
- `Stack search(value)`: returns the distance between the top of the stack and the
  target element if it's present; -1 otherwise. If the target element is at the top of the stack
  your code should return 0.

After you've made these changes, you might want to take another look through
your code and see if there's any refactoring you can do.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we got some practice building a data structure from scratch by
implementing a `Stack` class. Recall that the runtime of our data structure will
depend on what data structure it uses under the hood. For this lab, we used a
list as the underlying data structure, which means the runtime for the
`search()` method is O(n), and the runtime for all of the other methods is O(1).

While our implementation is efficient in terms of time complexity, we have to
consider space complexity as well. One of the characteristics of an `list` is
that each of the elements can be accessed directly using the `[]` operator. In
order for this to work, Python stores all the elements that need to be stored
 in a continuous block of memory. If we're trying to add an element and we're out
 of memory where the
list is located, Python will resize and relocate the continuous block to a bigger
continuous block of memory. This is expensive
in terms of memory, which means using a list as our underlying data structure
is not optimal from the perspective of space complexity.

Given that a `Stack` only uses `push` and `pop` methods, we don't need to use an
underlying data structure that allows direct access to all of the elements. A
better choice is a `LinkedList`, because it uses a Dictionary as _its_ underlying data
structure and Dictionaries do not need to be stored in a continuous block of memory.
The `LinkedList` is the next data structure we'll learn about. Before we get to
that, however, let's get a little practice using `Stack`s.
